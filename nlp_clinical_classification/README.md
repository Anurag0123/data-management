# NLP Clinical Classification

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify clinical text data. It processes medical records, extracting relevant information and categorizing them into predefined classes. The goal is to automate and streamline the classification of clinical documents for better patient care, data analysis, and research.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.)
- Medical entity extraction (using pre-trained models)
- Classification of clinical text into specified categories
- Evaluation metrics for model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `nltk`, `transformers`, `torch`, etc.

## Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Anurag0123/data-management.git`

2. Install dependencies creating a requirements:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:  
   `jupyter notebook nlp_clinical_classification.ipynb`

## Usage
1. Load your dataset into the notebook.
2. Follow the steps in the notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. Fine-tune the model and use it to classify new clinical texts.
